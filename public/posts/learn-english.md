>This is my own English learning plan.

---

As I started the whole process of learning code in 2022, I realized the importance of English. If you can read English documents or watch English videos, you will have the most up-to-date information. Not only that, but when I was learning the program, I found that the Chinese documentation was often less informative than the English documentation.

So, I intend to start studying English consistently in the new year.

Unlike many Chinese students, I prefer to memorize words, and memorizing words is a relatively easy task for me. But at the same time, I have a problem that my grammar is not very good, which causes me to write incorrect sentence expressions easily.

Every time it's my turn to write a blog post in English, I have to use a translator like deepl carefully to make sure my sentences are grammatically correct. I don't want to do that anymore, so I decided to relearn English, not just only for programming but also for exploring the possibilities of life.

Fortunately, I saw an English learning method in a book where an English teacher teaches you how to **use your English**.

Now I know that language is more like a human instinct. You should try to put yourself in an English environment and think in an English way. Here are the materials I intend to learn English:

1. [Use your English](https://book.douban.com/subject/35175246/)

2. [Learn English Grammar](https://book.douban.com/subject/1014914/)

3. ESLPOD
4. American Accent Training AAT
5. Memorize GRE words every day
6. Read at least 4 original books every year
7. Read technical documentation in English rather than Chinese

Although I have said countless times that I want to start relearning English again.

But this time is different from all the others. I choose to step out of my comfort zone from my free will, just like Neo.


Thanks for reading :)
