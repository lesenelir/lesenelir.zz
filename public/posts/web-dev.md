Today is the last day of 2022, and I have spent a lot of time coding over the past year.

In this post, I would like to talk about what I have done for the past year and give my opinion on "how to become a web developer".

### My learning experience

The biggest difference between 2022 and the previous year is that I have started to learn about coding systematically, especially in the area of web development. I started learning html, css, and javascript in December 2021 and spent a month learning all the relevant skills (Too young, too simple, sometimes naiveðŸ¤£).

The entire 2022 programming timelineï¼š

- Learning Vue from Jan to Feb.
- Spent half a month copying a simple vue admin system in March...
- Looking for an internship at the end of March (No internship foundðŸ˜­)
- Restart learning JavaScript from Apr to May (Javascript is so funðŸ¥³).
- Learning react in June.
- In July, an [admin management system](https://github.com/lesenelir/meta-react-admin) was built by koa2 and react.
- Start learning DApp development, Solidity, and Nextjs in August.
- Campus recruitment from September to mid-October.
- Learning [web3 knowledge](https://github.com/lesenelir/meta-learnweb3-dao-projects) from learnWeb3DAO in mid-September
- [Blog portfolio](https://github.com/lesenelir/lesenelir.me) built by Next.js in October.
- Start reading the beta.reactjs.org official documentation in November.
- December 1st school forced students to leave school (go home to start playing gamesðŸ¤ª)

I've taken a lot of wrong turns in my past learning experiences. In the next section, I will give my opinion on "how to become a web developer".

### How to become a web dev

To be honest, I prefer to call myself a web developer rather than a front-end developer for the reason that web development is what I really like to do but front-end development is much more involved.

If you want to become a web developer, you should certainly learn some web development-related skills, such as html, css, javascript, react or vue.

Trust me, if you are just starting to learn programming, you should go to udemy or bilibili to watch related videos to learn technical knowledge systematically. In the beginning, you may forget css knowledge quickly, but it doesn't matter, take notes and use css in your projects.

When I was new to web development, I put too much emphasis on learning frameworks like vue or react, which is the wrong way. In the beginning, you should focus on learning JavaScript fundamentals. When you think frameworks are hard to learn, it's actually because you are not good at JavaScript.

My advice on which one to learn, vue or react, is that you can learn both, but focus on react, as I prefer it. If you want to build some decentralized apps, I suggest that you should learn react. Now, many decentralized apps are built by react, rather than vue.

Technical skills:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vue or React (Recommend)
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Node.js
- HTTP
- Design

DApp skills:

- Solidity
- Ethers.js
- wagmi
- Hardhat
- IPFS
