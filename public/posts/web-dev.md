Today is the last day of 2022, and I have spent a lot of time in coding over the past year.

In this post, I would like to talk about what I have done for the past year and give my opinion on "how to become a web developer".

### My learning experience

The biggest difference between 2022 and previous year is that I have started to learn about coding systematically, especially in the area of web development. I started learning html, css, javascript in December 2021 and spent a month learning all the relevant skills (Too young, too simple, sometimes naiveðŸ¤£). At that time, my coding fundamentals were still so poor that  I learned all these konwledge simply.

Timeline related to programming throughout 2022ï¼š

- Learning Vue from Jan to Feb.
- Spent half a month to copy a simple vue admin system in March...
- Looking for an internship at the end of March (No internship foundðŸ˜­)
- Restart learning JavaScript from Apr to May (Javascript is so funðŸ¥³).
- Learning react in June.
- In July, an [admin management system](https://github.com/lesenelir/meta-react-admin) was built with koa2 and react.
- Start learning DApp development, Solidity, Nextjs in August.
- Campus recruitment from September to mid-October.
- Learning [web3 knowledge](https://github.com/lesenelir/meta-learnweb3-dao-projects) from learnWeb3DAO in mid-September
- [Blog portfolio](https://github.com/lesenelir/lesenelir.me) built with Next.js in October.
- Start reading the beta.reactjs.org official documentation in November.
- December 1st school forced students to leave school (go home to start playing gamesðŸ¤ª)

I've taken a lot of wrong turns in my past learning experiences.In the next section, I will give my opinion on "how to become a web developer".

### How to become web dev

To be honest, I prefer to call myself as a web developer rather than a front-end developer for the reason that web development is what I really like to do but front-end development is much more involved.

If you want to become a web developer, you should certainly learn some web development related skills, such as html, css, javascript, react or vue.

Trust me, if you are just starting to learn programming, you should go to udemy or bilibili and watch related videos to learn technical knowledge in a systematic way. At first you may forget css konwledge quickly, but it doesn't matter, take notes and use css in your personal projects.

When I was new to web development, I put too much emphasis on learning framework like vue or react, which is actually a wrong way. At the beginning, you should focus on learning JavaScript fundamentals. When you think frameworks are hard to learn, it's actually because you are not good at JavaScript.

My advice on which one to learn, vue or react, is that you can learn both, but focus on react, as I personally prefer it. If you want to work on the web3 application, I suggest that you should learn react. Now, many web3 applications are developed by react, rather than vue.

Technical skills:

- html
- css
- Javascript
- react or vue
- Typescript
- a little about node to build a simple backend
- HTTP
- design 

Thanks for reading :)
